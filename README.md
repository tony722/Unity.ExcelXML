# Unity.ExcelXML 
## Part of the open source Unity.Framework for Crestron

Crestron SIMPL# library for reading and writing Xml Spreadsheet 2003 files. 

You can open and save and work with "Xml Spreadsheet 2003" files in Microsoft Excel just like normal Xml spreadsheets (this format is basically a pure Xml representation of an Excel spreadsheet.)

_Note: Sometimes you will get a compatibility warning when saving, but this can generally be ignored. (Only a few very advanced features are not available in the Xml format)._
